# 1.what is middleware ?

Middleware is the function that works between the request and the response cycle. Middleware gets executed after the server receives the request and before the controller sends the response.

These functions are typically used to perform various tasks such as modifying the request or response objects, performing operations like authentication or logging, or terminating the request-response cycle.

Middleware functions are executed sequentially in the order they are defined, and they can either pass control to the next middleware function in the stack or terminate the request-response cycle by using the next parameter.
